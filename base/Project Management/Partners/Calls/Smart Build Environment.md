### 📝 Comments

requires 50% cofounding; [[LINK]] is ready to put 50%, then they would like their internal resources to be involved in the development. One way is to do it as separate entities, another one is to involve them as cofounders.

- Should be at least two partners, at least one of them based in Sweden;
- One of the applicants should be officially registered as a company;
- Needs a reference group and a steering group (reference group is an expert group evaluating the solutions to make sure the decisions are taken correctly; steering group has to consist of at least one person from each of the partners to take decision on the directions).
