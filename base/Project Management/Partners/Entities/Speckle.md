**Overview of the Proposal** Upskiller is developing a machine learning model capable of performing daylight factor analysis in a matter of seconds. With Speckle’s support, we believe we can produce a tool that uses that predictive ML model to offer real-time daylight factor predictions directly in Rhino or Revit through the Speckle platform, without requiring additional plugins installed locally.

**How It Would Work**

1. **Open Access Version**:
    - Users access the daylight analysis tool via the Speckle web platform.
    - This version would be free and provide basic functionality, allowing analysis of single rooms or specific windows.
    - Upskiller would contribute development hours, while Speckle provides technical support and assistance.
    - Speckle would host the ML model (we assume Speckle has strong cloud partnerships that could facilitate this).
2. **Pro (Paid) Version**
    - Advanced features, such as the ability to analyze entire buildings in a single operation or export results as a PDF, would be available as a paid offering.
    - This version would be developed in a second phase solely by Upskiller for monetization purposes, building on the success and learnings from the open access version.

**Future Opportunities for Development**: We also see significant potential in using a similar approach to develop additional predictive machine learning models for other performance analysis such as:
- Climate-based daylight metrics, which are becoming increasingly in demand.
- Energy use
- Embodied CO2 emissions
- Noise analysis
- Cost assessments.

These analyses are highly demanded and are often mandatory requirements for obtaining construction permits in many countries. Our vision is to collaborate with public institutions across Nordic countries, and other EU countries, to develop open predictive models adapted to local conditions and regulations funded through public innovation and research grants. Once these models are developed, we can integrate then through Speckle using the same workflow making sure these tools are accessible and widely adopted.

We could present this development in the [Velux Daylight Simposium](https://buildforlife.velux.com/en/daylight-symposium/call-for-abstracts)

**Benefits for Speckle**
- Daylight factor simulations are compulsory in Sweden. Currently, one daylight factor analyses take around 20-40 hours of a specialist’s work (often external, as only large firms can afford in-house specialists). Most projects need to do several daylight analysis iterations throughout the design process. This tool would allow architecture studios of all sizes to perform these analyses themselves and very efficiently, making it a no-brainer for them to adopt the solution and install Speckle once word spreads.
- Offering the daylight factor tool would enhance Speckle’s feature set as a vertical solution for daylight analysis.
- Increased user engagement and platform adoption, especially for small firms unable to afford traditional analysis tools.
- Exclusive collaboration, with Upskiller providing this tool only on Speckle (not on Autodesk Forma or similar platforms).
- If successful, the tool would create widespread adoption of Speckle in the Nordics, as they would need Speckle to integrate this analysis into their workflow.

**Our Questions**
- Would Speckle be able to host the ML model as part of this integration?
- Is it possible to track user data and telemetry to understand tool adoption and usage patterns? This would be essential for both future improvements and monetization strategies.
- Could we explore technical and business arrangements that allow us to charge for advanced features while using Speckle’s infrastructure?
