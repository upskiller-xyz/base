### ‚ö†Ô∏è Updates

==**Collaboration models:**== [[LINK]] sees two potential pathways for collaboration with [[Upskiller]]:
	1. **Development by [[Upskiller]] with Co-funding from [[LINK]]**:
	    - [[Upskiller]] undertakes the development work while [[LINK]] contributes a portion of the co-funding.
	    - In return, [[LINK]] becomes a premium user of the product, enjoying free access or a specific discount for a designated period.
	2. **Full Co-funding Provided by [[LINK]]**:
	    - [[LINK]] commits to providing the complete co-funding amount of 4 million SEK over the budget years (2025-26 and 27), with half provided in-kind (via hours worked by [[LINK]]'s staff on the project) and the other half in monetary terms.
	    - This funding arrangement covers 100% of [[Upskiller]]'s costs, which correspond to approximately 75% of the total project budget of 6 million SEK.
	    - The intellectual property created from this joint project will be co-owned by both parties. If either party wishes to use the project's results in subsequent developments, they must first offer the opportunity for further collaboration to the other party. Should the other party opt not to participate, they cannot prevent the initiating party from using the project results independently.
		‚ùì**Questions:**
		- *How would this intellectual property be shared? What percentage for [[LINK]] and [[Upskiller]] respectively?*
	**Collaboration with BuroHappold**
	    - BuroHappold could join as a partner, contributing resources in-kind without receiving direct funding, as they do not have a Swedish presence.
	    - They could also be part of the reference group or hired as hourly consultants for the project.
	**Coordinating Organization**
		- **Requirements**:
		    - Must be Swedish, with a valid Swedish organization number.
		    - Responsible for managing funds, overseeing Prisma administration, ensuring compliance, coordinating partners, and acting as the primary contact for Formas.
		    - Handles project structure setup, communication, and reporting.
		- **Recommendation**:
		    - It is proposed that LINK serves as the coordinating organization in this case.
**==Cost calculation:==**
	1. **Annual Cost Per Person**: Each full-time position has a cost of approximately 1.15 MSEK (including gross salary and social security payments) plus an additional 30% for overhead costs (we can use our overhead for licenses, trips, etc), resulting in a total of around 1.5 MSEK per FTE per year.
	2. **Project Budget and Resource Allocation**: With a total budget of 6 MSEK, the project will support approximately 3 full-time equivalent (FTE) positions distributed as:
    - **Libny**: 60% FTE
    - **Stasja**: 30% FTE
    - **Christoph**: 100% FTE
    - **Ale**: 100% FTE
	1. **Estimated Project Duration**: Based on the budget and distribution of FTEs, **16 months**. Probably longer if team members need to reduce their hours due to engagement in other projects or contracts we might get in the meantime.
==**Others**==
	- **Building Code in Sweden**: The increasing vagueness and open-to-interpretation nature of Swedish building codes highlight the value of tools that can assist in understanding and applying these regulations effectively.
	- **Social and Economic Sustainability / Equality / Gender Equality**
		- **Improved Efficiency**:
		    - Boosts efficiency and effectiveness in building design, significantly reducing construction costs.
		    - Addresses critical global challenges like the housing shortage and high construction costs.
		- **Inclusivity**:
		    - Reduces technical barriers for underrepresented groups, including women, socially disadvantaged individuals, and immigrants, who often face systemic challenges like limited access to education, financial constraints, and societal biases.
			-  Democratizes access to architectural design tools, fostering inclusivity in technical fields and opening opportunities for broader participation.
	 **Environmental Sustainability**
	    - Facilitates real-time integration of performance predictive models (e.g., daylighting, CO‚ÇÇ emissions, or energy use), such as those developed by Upskiller.
	    - Supports environmentally sustainable design and construction practices.
**==Implementation and Development Phases:==** To show the complexity and appeal of the project, it can be structured into distinct phases, each addressing specific objectives and delivering tangible outcomes. The proposed phases are as follows:
	**Phase 1: Prestudy and Feasibility Analysis**
		- **Objective**: Validate the foundational assumptions of the project and explore alternative approaches to ensure the chosen methodology is optimal.
		- Conduct a thorough evaluation of the proposed approach, identifying strengths and potential limitations.
		- Explore and compare alternative methodologies and strategies, updating the project plan if necessary to incorporate superior options.
		- Facilitate brainstorming sessions to identify potential applications of the technology, ensuring that development activities are aligned with future use cases from the outset.
		- Deliverable: Comprehensive feasibility report and updated project plan reflecting the best path forward.
	Phase 2: Development of a Stable BIM-to-Graph Conversion System**
		**Objective**: Create a robust and reliable system for converting Building Information Modeling (BIM) data into graph structures.
		- Design and implement algorithms for the seamless transformation of BIM models into graph representations.
		- Optimize the system for scalability and compatibility with diverse BIM formats and use cases.
		- Test and validate the system to ensure stability and accuracy in data conversion.
		- Deliverable: Functional and validated BIM-to-Graph conversion tool.
	**Phase 3: Integration of Graph Structures with LLMs for Natural Language Interaction**
		**Objective**: Enable intuitive interaction with the graph data using Large Language Models (LLMs).
		- Develop mechanisms for connecting the generated graphs with LLMs to facilitate natural language queries and interactions.
		- Design intuitive interfaces and workflows that bridge technical graph data and user-friendly natural language input.
		- Perform usability testing to ensure the system meets user expectations and industry needs.
		- Deliverable: Prototype system that integrates graph data with LLMs, enabling natural language interaction.
	 **Phase 4: Communication and Dissemination Plan**
		**Objective**: Increase visibility and ensure the project‚Äôs results have a broad impact across the industry.
		- Develop a strategic communication plan to disseminate findings and outputs to relevant stakeholders.
		- Organize workshops, presentations, and publications to showcase results and share knowledge with the industry.
		- Collaborate with the Smart Built Environment community to maximize the project's contribution to the sector.
		- Deliverable: Comprehensive dissemination plan and documented engagement activities to promote industry adoption of project results.
