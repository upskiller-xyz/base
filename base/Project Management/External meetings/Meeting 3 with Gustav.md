### üìÉ Agenda

- [ ] Review actions from [[Meeting 2 with Gustaf]]
- [ ] Gustav comes back to us with a proposal on how to address the negotiations with LINK

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Updates

### A. Equity Offer to LINK

1. **Equity Range Offered**: Offering 25%-40% equity to LINK to maintain control even after a potential second financing round, where equity may dilute but should not fall below 49%. We want to keep control of the company. The 25%-40% equity offer strategically anticipates future dilution but ensures that founding members retain majority control post-second funding round. This balance optimizes investment attractiveness while safeguarding founder influence and decision-making capacity.
2. **Building Trust**: we aim to make a reasonable offer to establish and maintain long-term trust and collaboration. Offering a fair equity share from the start is intended to lay a foundation for trust and mutual respect, crucial for long-term partnerships. It reflects a commitment to fairness and strategic alignment, which are essential for collaborative success.
4. **Justification arguments**: 
	- **Expert Validation**: Gustav's recommendation is based on the current 4 MSEK investment from LINK relative to the startup's developmental stage. Given that LINK‚Äôs investment will double if additional funding is secured, offering 25% initially reflects an equitable share considering the risks and current company valuation.
	- **Right product**: The product has significant potential for global application, which suggests a broad market and substantial growth opportunities. This scalability enhances the company's valuation prospects.
	- **Right timing**: Positioned at the intersection of AI and the construction industry, the startup addresses a critical market gap. By introducing advanced technological solutions to a conservative sector that is lagging in AI integration, the company is not only pioneering but also capturing first-mover advantages, which enhances its investment appeal.
	- **Right team**: high level of motivation, right set of competences (data science, tech, BIM, sustainability and building design) and long experience in the industry provides are a rare and valuable combination. This competitive edge is crucial in a sector that is beginning to embrace this type of digital transformation.
5. **Discussion Strategy**: Propose to speak first about the consultation with the expert and the arguments behind the equity percentage offered to demonstrate understanding and commitment to mutual benefit.

### B. Equity Distribution Among Founders

- **Equal Shares**: Following Gustav's recommendation, each founder (Upskiller founders) to equal percentages of equity between us.
- **Compensation for Initial Work**: Disparities in initial workload will be compensated via salaries, ensuring equity remains balanced in terms of long-term contributions and value.

### C. Additional Competencies Needed

- **Sales Strategy**:
    - Early phases may not require dedicated sales personnel.
    - Consider aggressive commission structures initially (50% of the first sale), reducing over time to 20% or 10%.
- **Leadership Considerations**:
    - If considering hiring an external CEO, prioritize sales competence over industry-specific knowledge, as per Gustav's advice.

These notes should guide your discussions and decisions moving forward, ensuring a strategic approach to equity management and team development.
