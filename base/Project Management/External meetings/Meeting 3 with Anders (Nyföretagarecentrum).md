### üìÉ Agenda

- [x] Check aktieagareavtal and aktieagaredirektiv

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Updates

#### Aktie√§garavtal (Shareholders' Agreement)
- Both the **Shareholders' Agreement (aktie√§garavtal)** and the **Shareholders' Directive (aktie√§gardirektiv)** are well-written and comprehensive.
- A possible addition to the Shareholders' Agreement: Include details about who signs invoices. For example, the CEO can sign invoices up to a certain amount (e.g., SEK 10,000). For higher amounts, at least one additional board member‚Äôs signature would be required (dual signature).

#### Collaboration with LINK and FORMAS Application

- It‚Äôs advisable to form a separate company (apart from Upskiller) for applying for funding to avoid potential confusion. FORMAS might interpret it as a lack of separation between the two actors (Upskiller and LINK) if LINK partially owns the Upskiller.
- Regarding the new AB we plan to create with LINK to develop the project where both LINK and Upskiller will be shareholders: Anders believes we can accept a **Letter of Intention** from LINK to formalize the collaboration later. After submitting the funding application, we have a few months before receiving the funds (if approved) to finalize the collaboration details. We could send our **Shareholders' Agreement** and **Shareholders' Directive** to LINK as examples to kickstart discussions about this new AB.

#### Intellectual Property

- Intellectual property and patents may not be relevant in our case since we don‚Äôt expect to produce anything patentable. However, we can include a specific clause stating that any intellectual property developed will remain within the jointly owned company.

#### Documents for Company Registration

When registering the company with **Bolagsverket**, three documents are required:

1. **Aktieboken** (Share Register):
    - A standard Excel file (Anders will send a template).
    - Each share should be numbered and specify who owns each share.
    - Include pre-emption clauses but leave the physical share certificate section blank.
2. **Bolagsordning** (Articles of Association):
    - Anders will send a template.
3. **Stiftelseurkund** (Certificate of Incorporation):
    - Necessary for registering the company.
    - Requirements:
        - 4 board members.
        - 1 chairperson of the board.
        - 1 CEO.
        - No deputy board members or auditors.

#### Contact Points

- For specific questions, **Bolagsverket** can be contacted directly.
- The bank can assist with legal questions and handle matters in the best way.

#### Accounting and Reporting

- Engage a specialized accounting firm for bookkeeping.
- Ensure the following:
    - **Annual Report (√Örsredovisning)**:
        - To be approved by us, signed, and submitted to Bolagsverket (done by the accounting firm).
    - **Tax Declaration**:
        - To be submitted to Skatteverket (Tax Agency).
