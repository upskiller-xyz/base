### üìÉ Agenda

- [ ] Describe the [project idea](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18rs04aNBXg9iPkO8oGxhLr7NpN5W98gymZ3AQvNqzNc/edit?usp=drive_link)
	The project we are proposing involves developing a robust system that transforms Building Information Modeling (BIM) data into graph structures, allowing for intuitive natural language interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs). This technology aims to streamline workflows, enhance design collaboration, and advance digitalization in both building design and urban planning sectors. Key applications include automating building code compliance, improving permit application processes, and enabling real-time cost and performance analyses. 
- [ ] Describe the call [[Smart Build Environment]]
	Smart Built Environment: proposals for projects that use digital technologies to enhance sustainability and efficiency in urban development. Eligible entities include businesses, public organizations, universities, and research institutes, with a requirement for joint applications involving at least one business or public sector partner. Funding requests can range from 500,000 to 4 million SEK, requiring 50% co-financing. Projects should last 12 to 36 months and align with one or more thematic areas such as Innovations and New Applications, Knowledge and Competence, Information Infrastructure, or Value Chains and Business Models. This initiative aims to accelerate the digital transformation in the built environment sector, promoting sustainable construction practices and innovative business models to advance Sweden's leadership in sustainable urban development.
- [ ] Understand their interest and what they can contribute with
- [ ] Suggestions of points to discuss
	**Scope of Collaboration**: Clarify what specific contributions BuroHappold can make to the project, whether it's expertise, resources, or both, and how they align with the project's goals.
	
	**Technical Expertise**: Explore the technical areas where BuroHappold‚Äôs strengths‚Äîperhaps in sustainable building practices or structural engineering‚Äîcan enhance the project.
	
	**Resource Allocation**: Discuss the potential resources BuroHappold could allocate, including personnel and technical tools, and how these resources would be integrated into the project workflow.
	
    **Role Definition**: Define their role clearly, whether as consultants, active partners, or advisory members, and outline the responsibilities associated with each role.
    
    **Financial Involvement**: Since BuroHappold may not provide direct funding, determine any in-kind contributions they might offer, such as consultancy hours or access to proprietary methodologies or software.
    
    **Intellectual Property**: Discuss any intellectual property that could be generated and BuroHappold‚Äôs stakes in it, especially if they are contributing significant expertise or innovative solutions.
    
    **Future Opportunities for Collaboration**: Explore possibilities for future projects or extended phases of the current project that could benefit from BuroHappold‚Äôs continued involvement.
