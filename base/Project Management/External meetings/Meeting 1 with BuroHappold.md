### üìÉ Agenda

- [x] Describe the [project idea](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18rs04aNBXg9iPkO8oGxhLr7NpN5W98gymZ3AQvNqzNc/edit?usp=drive_link)
	The project we are proposing involves developing a robust system that transforms Building Information Modeling (BIM) data into graph structures, allowing for intuitive natural language interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs). This technology aims to streamline workflows, enhance design collaboration, and advance digitalization in both building design and urban planning sectors. Key applications include automating building code compliance, improving permit application processes, and enabling real-time cost and performance analyses. 
- [x] Describe the call [[Smart Build Environment]]
	Smart Built Environment: proposals for projects that use digital technologies to enhance sustainability and efficiency in urban development. Eligible entities include businesses, public organizations, universities, and research institutes, with a requirement for joint applications involving at least one business or public sector partner. Funding requests can range from 500,000 to 4 million SEK, requiring 50% co-financing. Projects should last 12 to 36 months and align with one or more thematic areas such as Innovations and New Applications, Knowledge and Competence, Information Infrastructure, or Value Chains and Business Models. This initiative aims to accelerate the digital transformation in the built environment sector, promoting sustainable construction practices and innovative business models to advance Sweden's leadership in sustainable urban development.
- [x] Understand their interest and what they can contribute with
- [x] Suggestions of points to discuss
	**Scope of Collaboration**: Clarify what specific contributions BuroHappold can make to the project, whether it's expertise, resources, or both, and how they align with the project's goals.
	
	**Technical Expertise**: Explore the technical areas where BuroHappold‚Äôs strengths‚Äîperhaps in sustainable building practices or structural engineering‚Äîcan enhance the project.
	
	**Resource Allocation**: Discuss the potential resources BuroHappold could allocate, including personnel and technical tools, and how these resources would be integrated into the project workflow.
	
    **Role Definition**: Define their role clearly, whether as consultants, active partners, or advisory members, and outline the responsibilities associated with each role.
    
    **Financial Involvement**: Since BuroHappold may not provide direct funding, determine any in-kind contributions they might offer, such as consultancy hours or access to proprietary methodologies or software.
    
    **Intellectual Property**: Discuss any intellectual property that could be generated and BuroHappold‚Äôs stakes in it, especially if they are contributing significant expertise or innovative solutions.
    
    **Future Opportunities for Collaboration**: Explore possibilities for future projects or extended phases of the current project that could benefit from BuroHappold‚Äôs continued involvement.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Updates

- UK innovation funding call
	- No time for development, you just work on projects without time for reflection.
	- Industry is lagging behind in terms of data science adaptation compared to other industries.
	- UK government has identified this and wants to put some money to accelerate this. 
	- Funding calls SMI + established companies, building capabilities in the field. Lead needs to pay, government gives up to 100,000 pounds. Accreditation to be involved in the program, not so much the money that they are willing
	- SMI probably needs to be registered in the UK, probably not something for us
They are interested in the demo we sent them (co2 predictions, BIM2graph, NL interaction)
Use cases, retrieve data from projects, labelling things, MEP. 
Open source approach, they are willing to collaborate anyways. example: their unit BHoM.

Putting projects on a graph, retrieve important information from projects, repository of stuctural systems, scraping data from models. Natural language to querry it. 
People, which people work in these projects, expanding the graphs to people working in projects, 
Embodied carbon calculated: approximately based on previous co2 reports. 
**Idea for the collaboration with malm√∂: Municipality, apart from taking the climate deklaration, takes the revit model as a pilot test to when we will be able to have ifc building permit submissions.** 
Labeling, standardize labeling, use AI to interpret labels and make sense of them, cause its the wild west, everyone does different things. Postprocess models with LLMs to harmonize labels. BIM to Graph will give an extra layer to that because it can actually make sense of the labelling system, not only make sure that the system is harmonic. 
Workshops and reference groups, Marcelo would definitely be open to participate in our reference group. We have his permission to put himself down as part of the expert community in data science. 
Idea: Graphs of BIM models can be extended, bombining buildings into digital twin cities.

Internal grants: jetpags, 3 budgets for AI (
- business as usual, 
- AI innovation grants projects that are prioritized, learning plattform he mentioned
- jecpags (10 000 pounds each) comes from an internal employee, time and infrastructure. 
### üöÄ Actions

- [ ] Include Marcelo Lecocq in our reference group 
- [ ] Have a look at the [innovation call]([https://apply-for-innovation-funding.service.gov.uk/competition/2072/overview/37897e42-6e3e-43af-b13d-3e302bc0bcf9#summary](https://apply-for-innovation-funding.service.gov.uk/competition/2072/overview/37897e42-6e3e-43af-b13d-3e302bc0bcf9#summary)) mentioned by Marcelo.
- [ ] Schedule another meeting with Marcelo in February so that he updates us.
