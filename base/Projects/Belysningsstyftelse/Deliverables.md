**Deliverables:**

* machine learning model available to general public _that can be integrated in a design software_
* fit for swedish norms and regulations
* model should deliver fast and precise predictions to enable immediate changes in the design
* prestudy and analysis of existing solutions
* synthetic database that simulates different scenarios for architects
* comparison of different models and their hyperparameters
* model validation on real-world data
* research work (published or publishable) -> report
* documentation, guides and tutorials for architects on how to use the model in their design workflows
* feedback collection and analysis

**Expectations**

* demonstrate that advanced technology can make daylight factor analysis fast and cheap
* deliver the deliverables
