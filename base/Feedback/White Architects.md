Peter:
* spot-on
* would have strong potential if it works
* very early-on
* first mistake when building tools for architects
* Second mistake: why not do it like we always did without paying you?
* Third mistake: not thinking about the client
* work with startups and influence their direction (BobAI, spatial norwegian company, Finch)
* what is the value in it for us?
* tip: in norway the law is stronger than in sweden in terms of daylight, spatial has done something on it
Jimmie:
* looks nice BUT
* have you thought about incitaments for the architects?
* what is the business model?
* it has been a difficult year for the startup investment
Victor:
* like the chatbot
* combine text and visual input / output (graphs, pictures)
