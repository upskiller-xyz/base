These are questions that we need answers for about the funding call [[Smart Built Enviroment]]. 

- Is there a problem if the architecture studio is part of the startup's shareholders?  
    *The call guidelines do not explicitly discuss the implications of an architecture studio being part of a startup's shareholders in relation to funding applications.*

- Is the funding a loan that needs to be repaid, or is it a grant? 
	*The funding from the "Smart Built Environment: Digitalt samhällsbyggande i praktiken" program is provided as a grant, not a loan, which means it does not need to be repaid as long as the conditions of the grant are met.*

- Could you clarify if the project results from the 'Smart Built Environment: Digitalt samhällsbyggande i praktiken' funding call are required to be open source, or can they be proprietary to the developers?  
    *The project results from the 'Smart Built Environment: Digitalt samhällsbyggande i praktiken' funding call are not required to be open source. Developers can keep their results proprietary. The guideline specifies that while there is an expectation for open access sharing of data and results when publishing in scientific journals or similar platforms, this does not extend to the nature of the software or solutions developed (i.e., they can remain proprietary).*

- Is there any issue with the startup owning the intellectual property for the code it develops if the architecture studio provides the financial support for the project?
	*There should be no issue with the startup owning the intellectual property for the code it develops, even if the architecture studio provides financial support, unless otherwise specified in any agreements between them. The Formas guidelines do not require developers to relinquish rights to their results or intellectual property, even though adherence to intellectual property laws is necessary.*
