Presented in [[Meeting 3 with Arno (LINK)]]

**Why should they invest in this?**

- The tool has significant potential for international expansion in architecture and adjacent sectors, offering considerable returns for LINK.
- besides from direct returns from being an shareholder if LINK becomes early adapter of an innovative solution that would increase their efficiency, increasing in turn their profit margins, and strengthening its market position as an innovation leader, attracting clients and talent while boosting its reputation.

**Why LINK is a Good Investor for Us?**

- Both LINK and Upskiller are interested in using machine learning to improve efficiency and effectiveness in building design while achieving sustainability goals. This alignment ensures a shared vision and mutual understanding of priorities.
- LINK’s unique position as both an ideal client and investor makes them a highly valuable partner. Their industry expertise and direct relevance as a user provide feedback from a client’s perspective, helping us to create a product to meet real-world needs and challenges. 

**Why equity model?**

- Mutual long-term benefits: The equity model aligns both parties’ interests, maximizing the likelihood of the project’s success and profitability.
- The equity model avoids common conflicts in co-development agreements, such as disputes over IP ownership or diverging development visions.

**Why 25%?**

- Strategic autonomy protection: Retaining majority ownership is crucial to ensure Upskiller maintains decision-making authority and can guide product development according to its vision. According to Aaron a good investor wants to make sure that the developing team is motivated to obtain a good result and feels in control.
- LINK’s equity participation of 25% has been deemed fair by two experts separately given the fact that we are getting 50% of the funding through a grant, the rare combination of skills provided by the founders and the early stage of development and circumstances of the project. This percentage ensures a financial commitment without compromising Upskiller’s operational control.
